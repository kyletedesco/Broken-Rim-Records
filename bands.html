Described as "hyper-catchy and highly caffeinated" by the Philadelphia Weekly, I Call Fives has become known for their high-energy sound and relentless stage presence.

<br/><br/>
Since their formation in 2006, I Call Fives has been extending their horizons beyond the East Coast, hitting stages in 33 states across the country on a rigorous touring schedule.

First Things First has been highly acclaimed, earning the band multiple spots on Distortion Radio's top 100 Songs of 2008, among other accolades.
<br/><br/>
Kicking off 2010, I Call Fives returned to Baltimore, MD to record their second EP, Bad Advice, for No Sleep Records with Kory Gable of Pin Up Recordings. With this new release and non-stop touring to follow, 2010 will surely be the biggest year yet for I Call Fives.

<h1>Lions</h1>

<img src="Images/LionsWebsite.jpg" /><br/><br/>
Lions is based out of Knoxville, TN and has been releasing music and touring through DIY channels and families since late 2012. The four members of Lions prefer more out of the box approaches to write sporadic, clever, and often temperamental music alike stream of consciousness thought. They often utilize guitars, bass, drums, and singies to craft songs about the reexamination of the more visceral aspects of relationships and circumstance and plagues of the self. Lions does not feel at home in any one genre and would rather spend more time concerned where the next shoulder to shoulder house show, yelling worries away, will be hosted.
