stepped up to the plate. <br><br>

"In an effort to help our neighbors in Newtown, and families affected by
Friday's school shootings, we will be donating 100% of our Bandcamp donations to
the United Way of Western Connecticut. To show our appreciation, Anyone who

Forever Young is a high energy pop punk band from St. Louis. Breaking away from the "positive" wave of pop punk, their songs consist of emotionally bitter sweet lyrics and melodic guitar riffs. Heavily influenced by bands like Saves The Day and Brand New, the band delivers an exciting and fun live show. Forever Young's debut full-length, "Out On A Limb", will be released October 2nd 2012 on Broken Rim Records.<br><br>

<img src="Images/ICF-RBLVinylADWEBSITE.jpg" /> <br><br>
Two of today's hardest working pop punk bands, I Call Fives and Rust Belt Lights, have merged together to release a split 7-inch on Broken Rim Records. The split will feature two new songs from each band. Sticking to the bands' traditional style of song writing, but with a more energetic sound, the new songs have much to offer. The 7-inch will be available on limited colors through the Broken Rim Records webstore. All orders of the record include a free digital download of the songs, which will be emailed to you by the release date. A digital copy can be purchased at all digital outlets including, iTunes, and others. Pre-orders go live March 15th, all orders will ship no later than April 5th.<br><br>
I Call Fives had this to say about the upcoming split "I'm excited for the split, Rust Belt Lights is an awesome band we've played with a bunch before and we'll be spending a month on tour with them late this winter. Our two songs on the split are definitely more upbeat and a little more straight forward than some of our older stuff.<br><br>
Rust Belt Lights had this to say: "Our friendship with I Call Fives came about very quickly and the pieces just sort of fell into place with the split and our upcoming tour together.  We can't wait to get into some trouble with those dudes.  We pumped these songs out pretty quickly in between tours, which as a result have given them a really awesome, straight to the point, no bullshit punk rock sound."<br><br>
This record is available for pre-order through Broken Rim Records webstore<br>
